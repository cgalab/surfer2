  /* Note that, by construction, if you start on the wavefront edge, go out v0,
   * and go back v1, you end up on the wavefrong edge again.  Or, in other words,
   * v0-v1 is collinear with the direction of the wavefront edge e.
   *
   * Now, we want to know when e=AB collapses.  So we can restrict ourselves to
   * consider the projection of A+t*v0 and B+t*v1 to e itself.  Once they meet,
   * the edge collapses.  Equivalently, once the length of projected t*v0 and
   * projected t*v1 equals the length of e, the edge collapses.
   *
   * Let d be the vector AB (i.e., B-A).  The dot product v0.d is the length of
   * the projected v0 times the length of d.  So v0.d/|d| is the length of the
   * projected v0.  Likewise, v1.d/|d| is the length of the projected v1.
   * Thus e will collapse at time t := |d| / ( v0.d/|d| - v1.d/|d| ) ==
   * == |d|^2 / ( v0.d - v1.d ) == |d|^2 / ( (v0 - v1).d) ==
   * == d.d /  ( (v0 - v1).d).
   *
   * Isn't that interesting?  Note how we compare the length of d projected
   * onto d with the length of (v0 - v1) projected onto d?  Remember that, as
   * previously mentioned, by construction, (v0 - v1) is in the same direction
   * as d.  Thus, this quotient will have the same value regardless of
   * which line we project both d and (v0 - v1) -- as long as the line is not
   * orthogonal to (v0 - v1).  So we might just as well project onto (1,0) and
   * only consider their x-coordinates (if d is not exactly vertical).
   * So t == d_x / (v0_x - v1_x)
   *
   * This also makes sense when looking at it another way.  Consider the points
   * of the projection of A+t*v0 and B+t*v1 onto e.  Since they are on e, they
   * will become incident when and only when their x-coordinates is the same.
